Given Timelines, which are structured in this format: [Event A] - (relation) - [Event B] ..., your job is to naturally transform each timeline into useful information that can help an language model to generate a proper next response for Current Dialogue.

These are the explanation of each relation type:
1. Changed: when events in [Event A] changed to events in [Event B]
2. Cause: when events in [Event A] caused events in [Event B]
3. Reason: when events in [Event A] are due to events in [Event B]
4. HinderedBy: when events in [Event B] can be hindered by events in [Sentence A], and vice versa
5. React: when, as a result of events in [Event A], the subject feels as mentioned in [Event B]
6. Want: when, as a result of events in [Event A], the subject wants events in [Event B] to happen
7. SameTopic: when the specific topic addressed in [Event A] is also discussed in [Event B]

If a given relation is not proper, naturally connect them without using that relation.

Current Dialogue:
{current_dialogue}

Timelines:
{input_path}

Your Outputs (only the transformed timelines):
