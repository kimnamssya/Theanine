Your task is to find the relation between [Sentence A] and [Sentence B].
Keep in mind that [Sentence A] happened before [Sentence B].
The dialogues where each of the sentence is originated from are provided to help your reasoning.

First, identify if the relation holds among the following six relations:
1. Changed: when events in [Sentence A] changed to events in [Sentence B]
2. Cause: when events in [Sentence A] caused events in [Sentence B]
3. Reason: when events in [Sentence A] are due to events in [Sentence B]
4. HinderedBy: when events in [Sentence B] can be hindered by events in [Sentence A], and vice versa
5. React: when, as a result of events in [Sentence A], the subject feels as mentioned in [Sentence B] 
6. Want: when, as a result of events in [Sentence A], the subject wants events in [Sentence B] to happen

Then, if the relation does not belong to any of the relations from 1 to 6, choose between the following two options:
7. SameTopic: when the specific topic addressed in [Sentence A] is also discussed in [Sentence B]
8. None: when [Sentence A] and [Sentence B] are irrelevant

- For relations from 1 to 7, choose them only if there is clear evidence that matches the description of the relation. Otherwise, just choose "None" without making excessive inferences beyond the given sentence.
- Pay attention to who the subject of each sentence is.
- Do not confuse the roles of [Sentence A] and [Sentence B] when determining the relationship.
